    <h1>What is the chance of getting COVID-19?</h1>
    <h3>Problem/Data Domain</h3>
    <p>
      Currently, everyone's life has been affected by COVID-19. The spreading of
      the virus in the community that we lived in can be very concerning. It is
      true that many institutions such as
      <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map"> Johns Hopskins Univeristy</a
      >, are providing tracking of the number of cases around the world, but
      those information can't help individuals in real life. Now in the
      Washington states, business are starting to operate. However, people are
      concerning about going out in the community and get contact with people
      who confirmed with Covid-19. The current solutions to track covid-19 cases
      are only useful for researches and scientiest to keep track the
      government's job.The data most apps and website provided are too large and
      seems to far from real life. You can't expect every individual to worried
      about the Covid-19 based on how many cases were confirmed in the country.
      People only will take it seriously when data about their community are
      provided to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now, there are news articles such as
      <a
        href="https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-contact-tracing-apple-google/"
        >"How Covid-19 Contact Tracing Works on your Phone"</a
      >, explained a new project that Google and and Apple are working on. They
      are trying to design a track-and-trace system to keep track of individual
      cases. Once an individual confirmed positive, there recent public
      activities would be recorded in the system, and other users can know which
      places recently have confirm cases, so that they can avoid that area.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the privacy issue can be a barrier for that kind of track and
      trace system to be lauched eventurally. Thus, coming up with a solution
      where privacy won't be exposed while people can still be able to estimate
      their chance of getting the Covid-19 can be helpful. By knowing the chance
      of getting infected, people would be more careful and take this seriously.
    </p>
    <h3>App Description</h3>
    <p>
      This app/website will focus on providing information for user to identify
      their risk of infection of Covid-19 when they are out in their community.
      We are focusing specifically on residents of the Washington State. Since
      every states have different laws and conditions, and it would be more
      realistics to keep track of the data only in one state.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website will obtain data from
      <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/Coronavirus">
        Washington Department of Health</a
      >, and we might need to look into data from each county. For the risk
      calculation, we will use data from
      <a
        href="https://www.texmed.org/uploadedFiles/Current/2016_Public_Health/Infectious_Diseases/309193%20Risk%20Assessment%20Chart%20V2_FINAL.pdf"
      >
        Texas Medical Association </a
      >, to calculate user's chance of getting Covid-19 by their input activies.
      I want to see if our group can eventurally come up with specific
      calculations based on the user's current county's cases to give a more
      accurate number to the user. So users will required to enter their
      location, and types of activties for the number to be calculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once user get their chances of infection, they will take this more
      seriously. It might help them to consider stay home more and begin to wear
      a mask. I believe this website would help people make decisions on regular
      activities and helps slow down the spread of the Virus in the Wahsington
      State communities.
